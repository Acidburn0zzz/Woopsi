Installation
------------

  Installation of Woopsi is simple.
  
  1.  Download and install DevKitPro from http://www.devkitpro.org
  
  2.  Copy the folder "Woopsi/libwoopsi" from this directory to the root of the
      devkitPro folder.  In Windows, assuming all of the defaults were chosen at
      install time, this will be "C:\devkitPro"

  All done!
  
  
  To test the installation:

  1.  Open a command prompt and CD to the "Woopsi/template" folder
      (relative to this document).

  2.  Type "make".
  
  3.  Open the "Woopsi/template/Release/template.nds" ROM file in a DS
      emulator or copy it to your flash cart.
