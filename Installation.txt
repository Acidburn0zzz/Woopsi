Installation
------------

  Installation of Woopsi is simple.
  
  1.  Download and install DevKitPro from http://www.devkitpro.org
  
  2.  Copy the folder "Woopsi/libwoopsi" from this directory to the root of the
      devkitPro folder.  In Windows, assuming all of the defaults were chosen at
      install time, this will be "C:\devkitPro"

  3.  Copy the folder "Woopsi/libs/libfreetype" from this directory to the root
      of the devkitPro folder.

      Your devkitPro folder should now contain a "libwoopsi" folder and a
      "libfreetype" folder.

  All done!
  
  Alternatively, if you are using Windows, double-click the "Install.bat" file
  in this directory.  When prompted, enter the location of your devkitPro folder
  (by default, this is C:\devkitPro).  The installer script will automatically
  clean, compile and install Woopsi and libfreetype.
  
  
  To test the installation:

  1.  Open a command prompt and CD to the "Woopsi/template" folder
      (relative to this document).

  2.  Type "make".
  
  3.  Open the "Woopsi/template/Release/template.nds" ROM file in a DS
      emulator or copy it to your flash cart and load it up.
