 - Make the WoopsiString raise events when it is modified?
 - Is there a bug in the floodfill?
 - Remove flags?
 - Key events - should these bubble up the hierarchy?
 - Superbitmap draw methods should mark rects as dirty - GraphicsPort raises
   events?  A subclass of GraphicsPort?
 - Redraw as little as possible when adding text to textboxes.
 - Ensure all commands that should change onscreen display do so (ie. addOption
   in FileRequester - needs to work out where the option will appear in the
   list and mark that rect as dirty.  markRectDirty() method will automatically
   clip it out if it is off-screen).


Future
------

Woopsi
 - Woopsi class that applications inherit from should not also be the top-level
   UI component.  Need to create a separate "WoopsiApplication" class that
   handles all of the VBL/gadget deletion/etc code.  Also remove all static
   variables/methods.

Debug
 - Needs to support WoopsiStrings instead of char arrays.

New Gadgets
 - Tree
 - Tabs

Gadget
 - Move child manipulation into new GadgetCollection class?
 - Remove support for children from Gadget class?  Should all have it by
   default?
   
FileRequester
 - Hide the ".." directory and make a parent button?
 - File type filter.

WoopsiString
 - Use negative indices to work backwards from the end of the string, Python-
   style.

Focus
 - Come up with a way of representing this?

Appearance
 - Scrap the Amiga appearance and replace it with something unique?
