 - Key events - should these bubble up the hierarchy?
 - Redraw as little as possible when adding text to textboxes.
 - Ensure all commands that should change onscreen display do so (ie. addOption
   in FileRequester - needs to work out where the option will appear in the
   list and mark that rect as dirty.  markRectDirty() method will automatically
   clip it out if it is off-screen).
