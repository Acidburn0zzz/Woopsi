 - Key events - should these bubble up the hierarchy?

Future
------

New Gadgets
 - Tree
   
FileRequester
 - Hide the ".." directory and make a parent button?
 - File type filter.

Appearance
 - Scrap the Amiga appearance and replace it with something unique?

Won't Do
--------

 - Split Woopsi class into WoopsiApplication and WoopsiGadget - too tightly
   linked.  Makes no sense to split them.
 - Optimise MultiLineTextBox by redrawing only changed rows - too much
   functionality is tied into the subclasses and they don't give us enough
   information back to make the optimisations possible.
 - Split Gadget into Gadget and GadgetCollection - too tightly linked.  Makes
   no sense to split them.
