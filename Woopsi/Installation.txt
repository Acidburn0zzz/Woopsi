Installation
------------

  Installation of Woopsi is simple.
  
  1.  Download and install devKitARM from http://www.devkitpro.org
  
  2.  Open the folder "libwoopsi" in a command prompt and type "make".
  
  3.  Copy the folder "libwoopsi" from this directory to the root of the
      devkitPro folder.  In Windows, assuming all of the defaults were chosen at
      install time, this will be "C:\devkitPro".  In UNIX-like operating systems
      such as Linux and OSX, this will be "/opt/devkitpro".

  All done!
  
  Alternatively, if you are using Windows, double-click the "Install.bat" file
  in this directory.  When prompted, enter the location of your devkitPro folder
  (by default, this is "C:\devkitPro").  The installer script will automatically
  clean, compile and install Woopsi.
  
  
  To test the installation:

  1.  Open a command prompt and CD to the "template" folder
      (relative to this document).

  2.  Type "make".
  
  3.  Open the "template/Release/template.nds" ROM file in a DS
      emulator or copy it to your flash cart and load it up.
