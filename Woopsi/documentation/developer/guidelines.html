	<h1>Developer Guide - Creating a Simple GUI</h1>
	<p>Here are some guidelines you might find useful when building applications with Woopsi.

	<ul>
		<li>If you are creating a small application, create your application as a class rather than as a set of functions in main.cpp.  You can make that class into an event handler simply by inheriting from the base EventHandler class, and all of your handler code will be in the same scope as the rest of your code.  It makes things much easier.</li>
		<li>Always use the event system instead of trying to access the standard PALib input functions.  The stylus code in particular won't give accurate information after it has been read for the first time, so either your application or the Woopsi GUI code won't run properly if you interfere with Woopsi's normal input handlers.</li>
		<li>Use the SuperBitmap gadget for drawing to windows.  Standard windows do not store the graphics contained within them in order to save memory, so if you draw to a window and then refresh that window, anything you've drawn will be lost.  The SuperBitmap stores its graphics in RAM and refreshes the display as required.</li>
		<li>You can modify the look of the window borders by hacking away at the WindowBorderTop, WindowBorderSide and WindowBorderBottom classes.  However, user-defined border bitmaps are on my list of things to do.</li>
		<li>You can change the font by swapping the "font.bmp" file, running PAGfx, and recompiling.  However, the font width/height is currently hard-coded throughout the system, so you can't change the size of the font without going on a magic number hunt.  User-definable per-gadget fonts are on the to-do list.</li>
		<li>You can change the glyphs by swapping the "glyph.bmp" file, running PAGfx, and recompiling.  Same caveats apply as when changing the font.</li>
		<li>Always use the "gadget->addSubGadget()" methods to add gadgets to other gadgets.  This forces you to obey the hierarchies.  It would be possible to create instances of gadgets using their constructors and bodge the gadget class to allow generic gadgets to be added to its child vector, but you'll bypass a lot of the hierarchy setup code doing things that way.  You also may come across problems when a gadget encounters unexpected gadget types in its child list.</li>
		<li>If you don't need to change the properties of gadgets that you add into the hierarchy, you don't need to create pointers to them.  You can just call the "gadget->addSubGadget()" function instead of "Gadget* subGadget = gadget->addSubGadget()".</li>
		<li>If you want to create a lot of gadgets and need to retain pointers, the easiest way to do this is to create a vector and push_back the pointers into it as you add the gadgets to the parent.</li>
		<li>Woopsi will delete its entire hierarchy when it goes out of scope or gets deleted (depending on how you created the initial instance).  You don't need to delete any of the pointers you've obtained by adding gadgets; you just need to get rid of the pointers themselves, either by emptying your vectors (if you created them) or by allowing the pointers to go out of scope.  Attempting to delete gadgets manually will have strange effects and may cause a software failure.</li>
		<li>Look at the supplied Calculator and Pong demos for example implementations of Woopsi.</li>
